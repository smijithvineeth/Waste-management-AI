# Waste-management-AI
AI powered wastemanagement web APP
A chatbot feature integrated into a waste management application powered by AI. Let's break down the key components and functionality described in the code:

User Interface Elements: The code initializes several variables that reference various elements of the user interface, such as the chatbox, input field, and buttons. These elements are essential for user interaction with the chatbot.

Chatbot Functionality: The handleChat function serves as the core functionality for processing user messages and generating responses. It listens for user input events, such as pressing the Enter key or clicking the send button, and triggers appropriate actions.

OpenAI Integration: The handleChatGPT function interacts with the OpenAI API to generate responses using the GPT-3.5 model. It sends user messages to the API and processes the responses returned by the model. This enables the chatbot to provide intelligent responses based on the input received from users.

Database Interaction: The addNameToDatabase function appears to handle interactions with a database, possibly storing user-provided schedule times for waste management activities. It sends requests to a specified endpoint (ADD_NAME_ENDPOINT) to add schedule times to the database.

Dialogflow Integration: The handleDialogflowRequest function interacts with the Dialogflow API to handle natural language understanding and conversation management. It sends user messages to Dialogflow for intent detection and fulfillment, allowing the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries more effectively.

User Interaction Patterns: The code defines patterns for recognizing specific user intents, such as setting a schedule time for garbage pickup. When users input certain phrases or commands, the chatbot responds accordingly and guides the conversation flow.
